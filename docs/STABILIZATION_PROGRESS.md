## Current focus

Stabilization PR-01…18, Bulletproof P0–P5, X86 Golden Path Depth, Evidence
W1–W5, controller handshake, shared `count_byte` / `sum_i64` / `min_usize` slices
(VAA Gate-1/2), hardening T0–T6, runner JSON R0–R2, and Tranche M are complete on
`main`. GitHub Release **`v0.1.0`**, Tranche N–Q, X0/X1 object-policy depth, and
Tranche R (search→ingest Gate loop) are complete. **X2 + S + T** through
**X5 + H5 + Z** are closed (leaf/Gate/bridge treadmill saturated).

**Leaf treadmill paused** for thin HlaX64 bridges; **write-shape W0–W3** opened
`replace_byte` (ADR 0003 Accepted), **Wm** landed `memset`, and **Wc** lands
`memcpy` as the second dual-buffer write-shape follow-on (harness shape
resolved from the contract oracle, not vector layout, so `memcpy` can safely
reuse the `MemCmp` wire layout). Overlap stays fail-closed per ADR 0003: every
synthesized `dst`/`src` pair is a distinct, non-aliasing fixture buffer; the
harness checks the post-call `dst` buffer only, never `src`. **Rmem** (ADR
0004, region-precise memory gate honesty) has landed — docs-only, no
analyzer. Next up: **W4** HlaX64 `replace_byte` bridge. Gate-2
`ExecutionSandbox` (I2) landed on VAA (`execution_isolation` +
`--execution-sandbox`); this SemASM wave does not retouch that path.
decode/lower stay `partial`. Exception: bugfix / pin tip only. **Dx** landed
the decode/lower maturity-bump checklist plus one more adversarial
unknown-mnemonic-class and trailing-bytes-twin family (see below); decode/lower
remain `partial` — Dx documents when a future bump *could* happen, it is not
that bump.

### Next waves (X4 + H4 + Y) — closed

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **X4** | MemCmp harness fail-closed on AArch64/RISC-V + caps honesty | SemASM | **done** (`0c12bf7`) |
| **H4** | HlaX64 → VAA bridge for `find_last_byte` | HlaX64+VAA | **done** (`3641428` / `e105ea0`) |
| **Y0–Y2** | Pin tips + `memcmp` search `--ingest` Gate parity | VAA | **done** (`1c43236`) |

### Next waves (X5 + H5 + Z) — closed

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **X5** | Caps SysV write/indirect + A64/RV evidence sync | SemASM | **done** (`0305846`) |
| **H5** | HlaX64 → VAA bridge for `memcmp` | HlaX64+VAA | **done** (`eeac3ba` / `d807e21`) |
| **Z0–Z2** | Pin tips + `find_first_byte` search `--ingest` Gate parity | VAA | **done** (`9c2203e`) |

A64/RV MemCmp harness remains fail-closed (X4); X5 does not implement it.

Tranche X5 + H5 + Z closed: SemASM tip `0305846`; HlaX64 `eeac3ba`;
VAA Gate handoff `9c2203e` (pin SemASM `0305846`, HlaX64 `eeac3ba`).

### Maturity inflection (D0–D2) — design only

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D0** | Freeze leaf treadmill + inventory honesty | SemASM+VAA | **done** (this doc) |
| **D1** | ADR write-shape buffer leaves | SemASM | **done** (`adr/0003-write-shape-buffer-leaves.md`) |
| **D2** | Pipeline maturity + Gate-2 isolation criteria | SemASM+VAA | **done** (notes below + VAA) |

**Honesty:** Incomplete ≠ Verified. SoftHSM / Fulcio / practice seals ≠ Verified.
HlaX64 `-Wverify` ≠ SemASM Verified. Search ≠ CryptOpt. D* did **not** bump
pipeline; **M1** did bump x86 assemble/link/execute/pipeline_verify with owner
e2e jobs bound in `capabilities.toml`.

#### Leaf / Gate / bridge inventory (D0)

| Leaf | SemASM agent/e2e | VAA Gate-1/2 | search `--ingest` | HlaX64 bridge |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `count_byte` | yes | yes | yes | yes (VAA Thin Th1) |
| `find_first_byte` | yes | yes | yes (Z) | yes (VAA Thin Th2) |
| `find_last_byte` | yes | yes | yes | yes (H4) |
| `memcmp` | yes (x86; A64/RV fail-closed) | yes | yes (Y) | yes (H5) |
| `sum_i64` | yes | yes | — | yes (H1) |
| `min_usize` / `max_usize` | yes | yes | — | yes (VAA Thin Th8) |
| `replace_byte` | yes (x86; A64/RV fail-closed) | W3 | yes (VAA Th3) | yes (W4) |
| `memset` | yes (x86; A64/RV fail-closed) | Wm3 (VAA) | yes (VAA Th4) | yes (VAA Th5) |
| `memcpy` | yes (x86; A64/RV fail-closed) | Wc (VAA) | yes (VAA Th6) | yes (VAA Th7) |

**Not all buffer leaves are read-only:** `replace_byte`/`memset`/`memcpy`
declare `memory_write`. Region-precise store proof remains deferred (ADR
0003; honesty locked in **ADR 0004** — heuristic/dynamic harness evidence
only, not proof; see CI criteria checklist there before this line changes).

**Intentionally not continued** in the same wave as write-shape: A64/RV
MemCmp / replace harness, CryptOpt embed, formal `ensures` / full alias.
(`min_usize`/`max_usize` HlaX64 bridges landed on VAA's side as Thin
**Th8** — see VAA `docs/progress.md`; this row is HlaX64/VAA-owned, not a
SemASM analyzer or Gate change.) Thin Th1–Th7 closed on VAA (HlaX64 bridges
for `count_byte`/`find_first`/`memset`/`memcpy`, plus
`replace_byte`/`memset`/`memcpy` search-ingest); **Th8** closes the residual
pure-int bridges — **residual Thin is now closed on VAA; only Horizon
remains.**

#### Pipeline maturity bump checklist (D2 companion)

Do **not** change x86-64 Linux/Windows `assemble` / `link` / `execute` /
`pipeline_verify` from `experimental` → `verified_in_ci` until **all** hold:

1. **Owner CI job** named and green on `main` that runs golden-leaf
   assemble→link→run end-to-end (not only `agent verify`).
2. Job covers both SysV and Win64 paths claimed in `capabilities.toml`.
3. Failures are fail-closed (non-zero exit), not skip/warn-as-pass.
4. Caps comment block (Tranche O) updated in the same change as the bump.
5. `agent_verify = verified_in_ci` alone is **never** sufficient for a pipeline bump.

#### Pipeline ownership map (maturity follow-up M0)

| Capability keys | Owner CI job name | Corpus that proves the claim |
|---|---|---|
| assemble / link / execute / pipeline_verify (Linux) | `e2e (x86-64 Linux)` | `semasm-build` ignored pipeline tests + `fixtures/asm/exit.asm` deterministic build |
| assemble / link / execute / pipeline_verify (Windows) | `e2e (x86-64 Windows)` | `pipeline::tests::build_windows_pe_and_run` (+ NASM/lld toolchain steps) |

Honesty locked for the bump (M1):

- **`agent_verify = verified_in_ci` ≠ pipeline bump.** Win64 `agent verify` steps in the
  same Windows e2e job prove agent gates/harness, not assemble/link/execute.
- Pipeline corpus = the **build/run** fixtures above — **not** the full leaf list under
  `target.evidence.fixtures` (those are agent/object evidence lists).
- Gap before M1: Linux `ci_jobs` still lists only `decode (capstone)`; M1 must bind
  `e2e (x86-64 Linux)` / keep `e2e (x86-64 Windows)` when bumping.

### Maturity follow-up (M0–M1) — closed

| Wave | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Deepen ownership map + Gate-2 I0–I2 criteria (docs) | **done** |
| **M1** | Bind `ci_jobs` + bump x86 pipeline → `verified_in_ci` | **done** |

### Decode/lower depth checklist + adversarial wave (Dx) — landed

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dx** | x86 decode/lower bump-criteria checklist (M0-style ownership map) + one more adversarial decode/lower twin family | SemASM | **done** (this doc) |

**Honesty: Dx documents bump criteria and extends the adversarial corpus; it
does not bump `decode`/`lower`.** Both stay `partial` on every x86-64 target
after this wave (see `capabilities.toml`). Agent (this document, or a coding
agent editing it) ≠ pipeline. Incomplete ≠ Verified — a green adversarial
corpus is evidence the checklist owner reviews, not a self-certifying bump.

#### Decode/lower maturity bump checklist (Dx)

Do **not** change x86-64 Linux/Windows `decode` / `lower` from `partial` →
`verified_in_ci` until **all** hold (mirrors the M0/D2 pipeline ownership map
above — same discipline, applied to decode/lower instead of assemble/link):

1. **Owner CI jobs** named and green on `main`, and running the *adversarial*
   corpus (not only golden-path fixtures):
   - `decode (capstone)` — runs `cargo test --test agent_verify_adversarial
     _sysv_` (Linux/SysV adversarial twins, capstone feature enabled).
   - `e2e (x86-64 Windows)` — runs `cargo test --test agent_verify_adversarial
     _win64_` (Win64 adversarial twins).
   - `e2e (AArch64 Linux)` / `e2e (RV64 Linux)` — run the `_aarch64_` /
     `_riscv64_` adversarial filters via `cross-target-e2e`, for parity if
     A64/RV64 decode/lower are ever proposed for the same bump.
2. **Coverage criteria** the corpus above must keep proving, growing whenever
   a new gap is found (not just holding the current set static):
   - **Unknown/unmodelled mnemonic classes** — `count_byte_unknown_insn*`
     (AVX/SIMD-state class via `vzeroupper`) **and** `count_byte_unknown_insn_cpuid*`
     (privileged/CPU-identification class via `cpuid`, added in Dx). A single
     mnemonic class passing is not sufficient evidence of decode/lower depth.
   - **Decode-level trailing/undecodable bytes** after a valid leaf return —
     `count_byte_trailing_bytes*` **and** `find_first_byte_trailing_bytes*`
     (added in Dx: same decode gap, a second leaf/contract shape).
   - **W+X object-policy gaps** (`count_byte_wx*`) and **indirect-branch/call
     leaf rejection** (`count_byte_indirect*`) stay fail-closed.
   - **Win64/SysV parity** — every SysV adversarial fixture in this family has
     a Win64 twin (and vice versa) before either ABI counts as covered; Dx's
     new twins ship both sides together.
3. **Fail-closed, not skip/warn-as-pass.** Every fixture above must assert
   `semantic_failed` (or a more specific gate) with a non-zero exit and a
   `VerificationReport` JSON body — `#[ignore]`d for missing toolchain is
   fine, silently passing is not.
4. **Explicit: agent ≠ pipeline; Incomplete ≠ Verified.** This checklist
   existing — or the adversarial corpus being fully green — is not itself the
   bump. A named human/CI owner must review the corpus for completeness
   (mnemonic coverage against the real ISA, not just the fixtures on disk)
   and explicitly sign off in the PR that flips `decode`/`lower` to
   `verified_in_ci`.
5. **Caps comment block updated in the same change as the bump** (same rule
   as the M0/D2 pipeline checklist above) — do not bump the TOML value
   without updating the honesty comments that explain what the value means.

**Current status:** `decode` / `lower` remain `partial` on every x86-64
target (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) after Dx. Do
**not** bump until the Dx checklist owner signs off.

### Write-shape v1 (W0–W3) — `replace_byte`

| Wave | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **W0** | Accept ADR 0003 + contract/oracle | **done** |
| **W1** | `HarnessShape::ReplaceByte` + post-buffer check + memory honesty | **done** |
| **W2** | x86 asm/e2e/caps | **done** |
| **W3** | VAA Gate + pin | **done** |

Oracle: `builtin.buffer.replace_byte`. Harness verifies return count **and**
mutated buffer bytes. AArch64/RISC-V harness fail-closed. W4 HlaX64 bridge
deferred. See `adr/0003-write-shape-buffer-leaves.md`.

| Step | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H0 | Sync this progress doc | done |
| W4a | Oracle honesty (`contract_ensures` / `proof_basis`, schema 0.3) | done |
| W4b | Read-only buffer leaf gate (`semantic.memory`) | done |
| W4c | Golden demo / README oracle-vs-ensures clarity | done |
| W5a | Report provenance (`tool_version`, digests, schema 0.4) | done |
| W5b | `CONTROLLER_PROTOCOL.md` + status map for VAA | done |
| W5c | Golden `VerificationReport` fixture for consumers | done |

### Write-shape v2 (Wm) — `memset`

| Wave | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Wm** | `builtin.buffer.memset` contract/oracle + `HarnessShape::Memset` + x86 asm/e2e/caps | **done** |

Oracle: `builtin.buffer.memset`. Harness verifies the void-as-`0` return
**and** that every `buffer[0..length]` byte equals `value` after the call.
`memset` vectors are deliberately layout-identical to `BufferScan`
(array/null buffer + two numbers); `resolve_harness_shape` disambiguates from
the recognized contract oracle instead of vector layout alone, so
`generate_harness` / `evaluate` never collide with the read-only scan shapes.
AArch64/RISC-V harness stays fail-closed, matching `replace_byte`/MemCmp.
Next: **Wc** `memcpy` (dual-buffer write-shape; design-compatible follow-on
per ADR 0003). VAA Gate/pin for `memset` is **not** part of this wave — SemASM
only.

### Write-shape v3 (Wc) — `memcpy`

| Wave | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Wc** | `builtin.buffer.memcpy` contract/oracle + `HarnessShape::Memcpy` + x86 asm/e2e/caps | **done** |

Oracle: `builtin.buffer.memcpy`. Harness verifies the void-as-`0` return
**and** that `dst[0..length]` equals `src[0..length]` after the call;
`src` is unchanged input and is never echoed back (post-buffer Gate check
covers `dst` only). `memcpy` vectors are deliberately layout-identical to
`MemCmp` (two array/null buffers + a length); `resolve_harness_shape`
disambiguates from the recognized contract oracle instead of vector layout
alone, so `generate_harness` / `evaluate` never collide with the read-only
`MemCmp` shape. **Overlap fail-closed** (ADR 0003): every synthesized vector
uses distinct, non-aliasing `dst`/`src` fixture buffers — SemASM never
synthesizes or claims defined behavior for aliasing regions. AArch64/RISC-V
harness stays fail-closed, matching `replace_byte`/`memset`/MemCmp.
VAA Gate/pin for `memcpy` is **not** part of this wave — SemASM only; VAA is
untouched.

### Region-precise memory gate honesty (Rmem, ADR 0004) — landed

| Wave | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Rmem** | ADR 0004: lock what the memory gate may claim for write-shape leaves (heuristic/dynamic, not proof); CI criteria for ADR 0003's "only into declared region" wording | **done** (docs-only) |

Honesty: the static `memory` gate only runs for read-only buffer scans; for
write-shape leaves (`replace_byte`/`memset`/`memcpy`) the only region
evidence is the harness comparing post-call buffer bytes against synthesized
oracle vectors — dynamic, sample-based, x86-only, no guard bytes, no alias
analysis. See `adr/0004-region-precise-memory-gate.md` for the full honesty
statement and the CI checklist for when ADR 0003's wording would actually be
true. No analyzer, gate, or fixture code changed in this wave. Next:
**W4** HlaX64 `replace_byte` bridge (per ADR 0003's deferred-bridge note),
not an Rmem analyzer.

### Completed recently (not deferred)

- CFG / indirect-branch leaf policy wired into `agent verify` (`control` gate)
- Evidence card (`--card`), candidate compare, named versioned behavior oracles
- Oracle v2 splits weak contract `ensures` from `proof_basis: oracle_and_vectors`
- Read-only buffer leaf rejects explicit memory stores (`memory` gate)
- Controller handshake fields + stdout-only protocol for VAA adapters
- `sum_i64` shape `builtin.buffer.wrapping_sum_i64` (SysV + Win64 e2e)
- Win64 framed ABI: `mov rsp,rbp` restore + `[rbp±disp]` spill carve-out for
  compiler-produced leaves (needs dedicated regression lock — T1)

### Deferred (explicitly out of current waves)

- HlaX64 `replace_byte` / `memset` / `memcpy` bridges (W4)
- Gate-2 process isolation / `ExecutionSandbox` on Gate path (I2) — landed on
  VAA; not reopened here
- Formal `ensures result == count(...)` / general theorem proving
- Full memory alias / symbolic / region-precise store proof
- C compiler `-O2` / `-Os` binary-size bake-off in CI
- New ISAs or broad mnemonic expansion; A64/RV MemCmp / replace harness;
  decode/lower bump to `verified_in_ci` (Dx checklist landed — see criteria
  above; decode/lower remain `partial` until checklist owner signs off)
- Thin leaf / HlaX64 bridge treadmill (paused except write-shape W*)
- CryptOpt embed, live-model Gate CI, remote transparency, hardware HSM

### Shared vertical slice (SemASM + VAA) — done

| Wave | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| S0 | Lock honesty: next shared slice is `count_byte`, not `sum_i64` | done |
| S1 | Consumer golden `verified` JSON for count_byte | done |
| S2 | VAA CI Gate-1: live Incomplete (`execution_denied`) + seal chain | done (VAA) |
| S3 | VAA `--allow-execution` + Gate-2 Verified | done (VAA) |
| S4 | SemASM `sum_i64` contract/oracle/harness + VAA fixtures | done |

**Honesty:** Gate-1 (`execution_denied` → VAA Incomplete) is **not** a verified
vertical slice. Gate-2 requires opt-in execution.

### SemASM hardening (T0–T6) — closed

| Wave | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| T0 | Sync this progress doc (S2–S4 honesty + T* table) | done |
| T1 | Lock framed Win64 ABI + rbp-spill exemption with tests | done |
| T2 | `sum_i64` consumer goldens + oracle v2 | done |
| T3 | `sum_i64` adversarial memory-write twins | done |
| T4 | Contract/harness mismatch fail-closed | done |
| T5 | A64/RV `control`/`memory` → `skipped` when unimplemented | done |
| T6 | Pure-int oracle claim names `min` | done |

Tranche SemASM hardening is closed on `main`. VAA pin / framed smoke waves
**N0–N4** and stack integrity **P0–P2** are done (see VAA `docs/progress.md`).

### Runner + SemASM JSON (R0–R2) — closed

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| R0 | Honesty docs: P* closed; next = R* | both | done |
| R1 | VAA ProcessRunner streaming cap + Win stdin EOF | VAA | done |
| R2 | SemASM `version`/`status --format json` | SemASM | done |

VAA post-alpha trust depth (**P7** / **P8**) is Done on the consumer side
(practice seals, SoftHSM smoke, Fulcio opt-in ≠ SemASM Verified).

### Tranche M (M0–M4) — closed

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Tip honesty: ROADMAP + this file point to Tranche M | SemASM | **done** |
| **M1** | `capabilities.toml` evidence fixtures include `sum_i64` corpus | SemASM | **done** |
| **M2** | `min_usize` Gate-ready pack (goldens / twins / honesty parity) | SemASM | **done** |
| **M3** | One x86 adversarial twin wave around golden path | SemASM | **done** |
| **M4** | VAA pin tip + `min_usize` Gate-1/2 fixtures/smoke | VAA | **done** |

### Release tip `v0.1.0` — done

Annotated tag + GitHub Release archives (`SHA256SUMS`) after
`docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` gates. No crates.io publish in this ceremony.

### Next waves (N0–N2 — Tranche N, post-`v0.1.0`)

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **N0** | `max_usize` oracle/claim distinction + contract (min regression) | SemASM | **done** |
| **N1** | `max_usize` asm/e2e/goldens/adversarial + capabilities evidence | SemASM | **done** |
| **N2** | VAA pin tip + `max_usize` Gate-1/2 fixtures/smoke | VAA | **done** |

**Honesty:** Gate-1 Incomplete ≠ Verified. SoftHSM / Fulcio / practice seals ≠
SemASM Verified. Pipeline assemble/link/execute on x86 remains `experimental`.

Demo: `scripts/golden-demo.sh` (Linux SysV) or `scripts/golden-demo.ps1`
(Windows PE by default; `-SysV` for Linux tools).

Tranche N is closed on tip `623d22c` (SemASM) with VAA handoff `5a5c6d9`.

### Next waves (O0–O1 — Tranche O, x86 depth)

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **O0** | Caps/docs honesty: x86 pipeline stays experimental; next = O→P | SemASM | **done** |
| **O1** | One adversarial family around `sum_i64` / Win64 decode-gap parity | SemASM | **done** |

### After O — Tranche P (`find_first_byte` Gate)

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0** | Oracle/contract/vectors (absent → length) | SemASM | **done** |
| **P1** | Asm/e2e/goldens/adversarial + capabilities | SemASM | **done** |
| **P2** | VAA pin tip + Gate-1/2 smoke | VAA | **done** |

Buffer index-of shape (not another pure-int leaf). Pattern N0→N2 / M2→M4.

Tranche P is closed on tip `511bb45` (SemASM) with VAA handoff `5961c1b`.

### Next waves (Q0… + X0 — VAA loop + further x86 depth)

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Q0** | Caps/docs honesty: next = VAA repair/search loop + x86 depth | SemASM+VAA | **done** |
| **Q1** | `find_first_byte` multi-candidate `vaa run` wrong→repair Gate smoke | VAA | **done** |
| **Q2** | `vaa search` nop-slide staging Gate smoke (offline; ≠ CryptOpt/Verified) | VAA | **done** |
| **X0** | Win64 W+X object-policy (patched COFF; NASM cannot emit W+X code) | SemASM | **done** |

Tranche Q + X0 closed on tip `7fa6e18` (SemASM) with VAA handoff `80f848b`.

### Next waves (R0–R1 + X1 — search→ingest + object-policy depth)

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R0** | Caps/docs honesty: next = search→ingest + Win64 import/noexport | SemASM+VAA | **done** |
| **X1** | Win64 import + noexport object-policy twins (parity SysV) | SemASM | **done** |
| **R1** | `vaa search` staging → `vaa ingest` Gate smoke + verify-chain | VAA | **done** |

Tranche R + X1 closed on tip `c8f2047` (SemASM) with VAA handoff `171b553`.

### Next waves (X2 + S + T)

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **X2a** | Win64 syscall + stack_imbalance object/capability twins | SemASM | **done** (asm encoding fix) |
| **X2b** | VAA mutator `nop-before-ret` | VAA | **done** (`9a490d3`) |
| **S0** | `find_last_byte` oracle/contract/vectors (absent→length) | SemASM | **done** |
| **S1** | `find_last_byte` asm/e2e/goldens/adversarial + CI | SemASM | **done** (`b6d3395`) |
| **S2** | VAA pin + Gate-1/2 (+ run wrong→repair) | VAA | **done** (`dcbc536`) |
| **T0–T2** | `vaa search --ingest` skip Violated → Incomplete | VAA | **done** (`dcbc536`) |

Tranche X2 + S + T closed: SemASM tip `1d57e8d` / functional S1 `b6d3395`;
VAA handoff `1ad5d0e` (S2+T content `dcbc536`).

### Next waves (X3 + U + V)

| Wave | Focus | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **X3** | Win64 `count_byte` callee_saved twin + caps write/indirect sync | SemASM | **done** (`b9a7079`) |
| **U0** | `memcmp` dual-buffer oracle/contract/vectors | SemASM | **done** (`da8b57a`) |
| **U1** | `memcmp` asm/e2e/goldens/adversarial + CI | SemASM | **done** (`ca959f3`) |
| **V0–V3** | VAA pin + memcmp Gate + search allow-execution smoke | VAA | **done** |

SysV `count_byte_red_zone` pairs with Win64 `count_byte_win64_shadow` as the ABI dual
(not a literal `*_red_zone_win64` name twin).

Tranche X3 + U + V closed: SemASM tip
`b8d24c1` / functional U1 `ca959f39924a34a3bca2a5effe71e96e63238250`;
VAA Gate handoff `a9f926d` / V3 docs `789f7ad` (CI pin remains U1 `ca959f3`).

**Honesty:** Gate-1 Incomplete ≠ Verified. SoftHSM / Fulcio / practice seals ≠
SemASM Verified. Pipeline assemble/link/execute on x86 remains `experimental`.
LLM / search mutator output ≠ Verified. `memcmp` oracle/vectors ≠ formal
`ensures`/alias proof. Gate-2 `search --ingest --allow-execution` Verified ≠
CryptOpt. MemCmp harness is x86-only; AArch64/RISC-V fail closed (X4). NASM
win64 does not emit WRITE on code sections; X0 uses
`fixtures/obj/count_byte_wx_win64.obj` (WRITE|EXECUTE patched).

Demo: `scripts/golden-demo.sh` (Linux SysV) or `scripts/golden-demo.ps1`
(Windows PE by default; `-SysV` for Linux tools).

See `docs/CLI_COMPATIBILITY.md`, `docs/CONTROLLER_PROTOCOL.md`,
`docs/AGENT_SCHEMA_POLICY.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
